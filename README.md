# About

This project is built entirely upon the work of nihilist-dev: https://github.com/nihilist-dev/NowPlaying

It is a Plasma Widget that shows the media current playing on your desktop and allows you to control it.

This version adds the functionality of changing the alignment of the widget between Left Aligned and Right Aligned. I plan to add other functionalities in the future.

The easiest way to install the widget is through KDE, you just need to follow these steps:

1. Right Click Panel > Panel Options > Add Widgets
2. Get New Widgets > Download New Widgets
3. Search: NowPlayingRe
4. Install

Otherwise, you can install it using your terminal and git:

You will be able to find this widget in the `Add Widget` Menu

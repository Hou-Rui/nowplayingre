# About

This project is built entirely upon the work of nihilist-dev: https://github.com/nihilist-dev/NowPlaying

It is a Plasma Widget that shows the media current playing on your desktop and allows you to control it.

This version adds the functionality of changing the alignment of the widget between Left Aligned and Right Aligned. I plan to add other functionalities in the future.
